Rasa as Open Source Alternative to Amazon Lex - Migration Tips
==============================================================


.. raw:: html

     There is no support for Amazon Lex yet. However, there seems to be a way to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/import-export.html" target="_blank">export data into JSON from Lex</a>. If you're interested in building an integration, please start a thread in our <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.rasa.com/" target="_blank">Community Forum</a>.


At Rasa, we hear a few different reasons why developers switch from cloud-based tools like Amazon Lex:

* **Faster**: Runs locally - no https requests and server round trips required
* **Customizable**: Tune models and get higher accuracy with your data set
* **Open source**: No risk of vendor lock-in - the Rasa Stack comes with an Apache 2.0 licence and you can use it commercial projects

     In addition, our open source tools allow developers to build contextual AI assistants and manage dialogues with machine learning instead of rules - learn more in <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.rasa.com/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.

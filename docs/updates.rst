:desc: What's new with Rasa Stack and Platform

What's New?
===========

August 2018
~~~~~~~~~~~

Rasa Core 0.11 is out!
----------------------
This is a major update, which requires a little migration work, but 
greatly simplifies deploying Rasa Core in production. Custom actions are now run in a separate
server, which you can create using the new `rasa_core_sdk <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core_sdk>`_.

- Check out the detailed `changelog <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_, `migration instructions <http://rasa.com/docs/core/migrations/>`_, and `livestream <https://forum.rasa.com/t/rasa-core-sdk-live-stream/826>`_.
- Rasa Core 0.11 also ships with the new ``EmbeddingPolicy``, implemented in tensorflow and described in a paper (link coming soon). 
- **For Rasa Platform Users**: Rasa Platform 0.16 (coming September 2018) will depend on Rasa Core 0.11. Please ensure that you migrate before updating your installation. This update is necessary to enable new platform features, and to make deployment and maintenance simpler. If you have any questions about migrating to Rasa Core 0.11, please use your dedicated support email to reach out.

All new docs!
-------------

- Interactive quickstarts for Rasa NLU and Rasa Core
- Unified search across all docs, and all docs now at https://rasa.com/docs
- Reorganized Rasa NLU and Core docs, splitting 'learning' from 'reference' material

Community Forum
---------------

We felt that a lot of good discussions were getting lost on gitter. So we're moving the 
community support over to the newly created `Rasa Community Forum <https://forum.rasa.com>`_
It's going to be a great place for the Rasa community to meet, find answers to questions,
participate in discussions, share ideas and keep up to date with the most recent Rasa updates.

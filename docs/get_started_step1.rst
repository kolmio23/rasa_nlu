Rasa NLU's job is to interpret messages, and Rasa Core's job is to decide what should happen next.

The Rasa Stack is a framework to build contextual AI assistants and chatbots. It consists of two open source libraries (Rasa NLU and Rasa Core).
Using state-of-the-art machine learning, your bots can hold contextual conversations with
users. Rasa is production ready and used in large companies everywhere.

The Rasa Stack is a pair of open source libraries (Rasa NLU and Rasa Core) that allow
developers to expand chatbots and voice assistants beyond answering simple questions.
Using state-of-the-art machine learning, your bots can hold contextual conversations with
users. Rasa is production ready and used in large companies everywhere.   

Rasa NLU performs `Natural Language Understanding`, which means taking free-form text like

.. pull-quote:: `Please send the confirmation to amy@example.com`

and turning it into structured data.
Rasa Core performs `Dialog Management`, which means keeping track of a conversation, and deciding
how to proceed. Both Rasa Core and NLU use Machine Learning to learn from real example conversations.

Rasa NLU and Core are independent. You can use NLU without Core, and vice versa.

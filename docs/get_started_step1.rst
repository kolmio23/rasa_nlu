   <b>The Rasa Stack</b> is a set of open source machine learning tools for developers to create <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.rasa.com/level-3-contextual-assistants-beyond-answering-simple-questions/" target="_blank">contextual AI assistants and chatbots</a>:

* **Core** = a chatbot `framework` with machine learning-based dialogue management
* **NLU** = a `library` for natural language understanding with intent classification and entity extraction

NLU and Core are independent. You can use NLU without Core, and vice versa. We recommend using both.

**Lets start with an example.** Imagine you've built an AI assistant that sells renters insurance. At the end, you ask your user `Which email shall I send the confirmation to?` and they respond with `Please send the confirmation to amy@example.com`. Now it is time for the Rasa Stack to get to work:

1. **NLU** understands the user's message based on your previous training data:

* **Intent classification**: Interpreting meaning based on predefined intents (Example: `Please send the confirmation to amy@example.com` is a ``provide_email`` intent with 93% confidence)
* **Entity extraction**: Recognizing structured data (Example: `amy@example.com` is an ``email``)

2. **Core** decides what happens next in this conversation. It's machine learning-based dialogue management predicts the **next best action** based on the input from NLU, the conversation history and your training data. (Example: Core has a confidence of 87% that ``ask_primary_change`` is the next best action to confirm with the user if they want to change their primary contact information.)
